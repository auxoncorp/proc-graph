/An actor network./

** Introduction

This library is a testbed which takes a yaml-defined graph and turns
that graph into a set of processes which communicate according to the
graph. For example, the graph decribed below:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
# TODO: change this to the map-style graph.
graph:
  root: a
  vertices:
    - name: a
      egress:
        - b
        - c
    - name: b
      egress:
        - d
    - name: c
      egress:
        - d
    - name: d
#+END_SRC

Will build a network of four processes to communicate like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC
     +->(b)--+
     |       |
(a)--+       +->(d)
     |       |
     +->(c)--+
#+END_SRC

To be valid, a graph must a) contain a root and b) be acyclic.

These graphs will act as unique testbeds for a future tracing library
where the given graph and its resultant processes can be subject to
the tracing library whose results we can analyze against the known
shape of the graph to determine at least one form of "correctness" for
that trace.
